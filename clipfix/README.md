# Clip Fix

Benjamin Schwartz' Nyquist plugin made standalone and parallelized via bash wrapper.

Good for declipping albums which are victims of the loudness war.

```shell
/tmp $ clipfix ~/Music/Clipped_Album/*
/home/you/Music/Clipped_Album/01 - Title.flac
    => /tmp/01 - Title - declipped.flac
...
```
